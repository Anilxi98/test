# Portfolio Management and Optimization Based on Machine Learning Methods
This is the readme file for our final project.
# Introduction
For the data preprocessing.ipynb file, it should be placed on a platform named "JointQuant" because there are many APIs, such as get_factor_values and get_index_stocks, that can only be used on the "JointQuant" platform.
JointQuant plantform is avaiable on :https://www.joinquant.com/
