# Portfolio Management and Optimization Based on Machine Learning Methods
This is the readme file for our final project.
# Introduction
For the data preprocessing.ipynb file, it should be placed on a platform named "JointQuant" because there are many APIs, such as get_factor_values and get_index_stocks, that can only be used on the "JointQuant" platform.

JointQuant plantform is avaiable on :https://www.joinquant.com/

For Lightgbm_stock_prediction.ipynb file, it can be placed on either "JointQuant" or local IDE. It should be noted that it will generate "lgb_ZZ500_method*_industry_netreulization" xlsx files under the /code folder for convenient use in calculating future profit and other indicators.

# Guidance
We referred to a research paper from Huatai Securities to conduct our project. The research paper and all the reference codes that we used are available on https://www.joinquant.com/view/community/detail/e335e464e3233b5623c7b30f495807ac?type=1
